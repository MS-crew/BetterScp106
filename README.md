This add-on for SCP: Secret Laboratory brings new features closer to the lore for the existing SCP-106. The plugin provides a number of customizable features to enhance your server's gaming or RP experience.
</div>

## Commands Features

- **Pocket:** With this command, 106 can return to her own pocket dimension (unless the warhead has exploded in order not to spoil the game experience/and now you can do it with the [C]/sneak walk key).
- **Pocket in:** With this command, 106 can pull a scp he goes near to his pocket dimension (Scp trying to be taken to pocket can reject it by pressing the [ALT] key).
- **Stalk:** The most important feature is that if there is an injured victim, you can teleport to a place where he is with the stalk feature (the victim is warned 1 second in advance/and now you can do it with the [ALT] key).
- **Better106:** It tells you all the features of the 106 and how much they will cost.
- **Flexible management:** With the config file, you can determine which feature will cost how much vigor or healt, how many meters away the victim can be teleported to the nearby victim with Stalk, or how long the cooldown time will be given to Scp-106 by which feature.

## Experimental feature

- **Pocket exit random zone mode:** When players successfully exit the pocket dimension, they exit from a random zone depending on chance instead of the same zone.
- **Realistic Pocket mode:** Pocket dimension is not affected by warhead explosion and effect.
